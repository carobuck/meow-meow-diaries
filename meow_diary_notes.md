## The Meow Meow Diaries

Mick's gone for a week and left me in charge of Meow Meow. Here's what happened.

#### Day 1: 3/14/22
(Technically Mick left yesterday, but I had this idea today so I've decided today is day 1).
* It's Pi day. I didn't have any pie (neither did Meow Meow).
* One scratch (on the shin). She didn't like that I wanted to box in the AM in the living room.
* One failed jump (she missed the table and kinda fell on my leg...she disappeared for a few minutes after this)
* One mysterious incident with the wire cooling rack (parkour??)
* One cute photo (Meow got into the boxes on the coffee table)
* Moderate amount of head/neck pats (I discover that Meow's neck is her softest fur)
* Meow Meow is the only living creature I spoke to IRL today. Everyone else (family, coworkers and networking event) was virtual
