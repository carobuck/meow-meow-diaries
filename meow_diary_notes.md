## The Meow Meow Diaries

Mick's gone for a week and left me in charge of Meow Meow. Here's what happened.

#### Day 1: 3/14/22
(Technically Mick left yesterday, but I had this idea today so I've decided today is day 1).
* It's Pi day. I didn't have any pie (neither did Meow Meow).
* One scratch (on the shin). She didn't like that I wanted to box in the AM in the living room.
* One failed jump (she missed the table and kinda fell on my leg...she disappeared for a few minutes after this)
* One mysterious incident with the wire cooling rack (parkour??)
* One cute photo (Meow got into the boxes on the coffee table)
* Moderate amount of head/neck pats (I discover that Meow's neck is her softest fur)
* Meow Meow is the only living creature I spoke to IRL today. Everyone else (family, coworkers and networking event) was virtual
* One late night staring contest (can't tell if she's love blinking or winking)
* Toys played with: cap thing from coat rack, toilet paper tube, toilet paper wrapper
* Moderate meow whining looking for cuddles/Mick at night
* Meows "helps" take care of the plants. Temporarily gets stuck on windowsill. Pines for her long lost love (Mick)
* One treat given for bedtime

#### Day 2: 3/15/22
* Caro talks with 1 person, Daniel G., IRL to sell a rolling cart
* Toys played with: paper measuring tape, plastic wrapper (see below)
* Limited interaction during work day
* Considered picking meows up for the first time
* Halfheartedly played with plastic wrapper (by halfhearted, I tried and Meows ignored me for the most part)
* Actually picked Meows up for the first time (felt weird; a vulnerable position)
* Picked meows up a second time, tried to do the butt thing Mick does. Didn't quite nail it. Escaped unscathed though, so that's a win.
* One shin claw attempt when I wouldn't let her in the laundry area
* Side note: received three months' worth of love (from an animal) from Duckie in one sitting. Great convo with a human IRL too (Timmy)
* Meow's mood this evening: Needy/vocal/trying to break through the baby gate into my room
