## The Meow Meow Diaries

Mick's gone for a week and left me in charge of Meow Meow. Here's what happened.

#### Day 1: 3/14/22
(Technically Mick left yesterday, but I had this idea today so I've decided today is day 1).
* It's Pi day. I didn't have any pie (neither did Meow Meow).
* One scratch (on the shin). She didn't like that I wanted to box in the AM in the living room.
* One failed jump (she missed the table and kinda fell on my leg...she disappeared for a few minutes after this)
* One mysterious incident with the wire cooling rack (parkour??)
* One cute photo (Meow got into the boxes on the coffee table)
* Moderate amount of head/neck pats (I discover that Meow's neck is her softest fur)
* Meow Meow is the only living creature I spoke to IRL today. Everyone else (family, coworkers and networking event) was virtual
* One late night staring contest (can't tell if she's love blinking or winking)
* Toys played with: cap thing from coat rack, toilet paper tube, toilet paper wrapper
* Moderate meow whining looking for cuddles/Mick at night
* Meows "helps" take care of the plants. Temporarily gets stuck on windowsill. Pines for her long lost love (Mick)
* One treat given for bedtime

#### Day 2: 3/15/22
* Caro talks with 1 person, Daniel G., IRL to sell a rolling cart
* Toys played with: paper measuring tape, plastic wrapper (see below)
* Limited interaction during work day
* Considered picking meows up for the first time
* Halfheartedly played with plastic wrapper (by halfhearted, I tried and Meows ignored me for the most part)
* Actually picked Meows up for the first time (felt weird; a vulnerable position)
* Picked meows up a second time, tried to do the butt thing Mick does. Didn't quite nail it. Escaped unscathed though, so that's a win.
* One shin claw attempt when I wouldn't let her in the laundry area
* Side note: received three months' worth of love (from an animal) from Duckie in one sitting. Great convo with a human IRL too (Timmy)
* Meow's mood this evening: Needy/vocal/trying to break through the baby gate into my room
* Creatures I spoke to IRL (besides Meow and myself): 4 (Janet and Michael at boxing, plus two above)

#### Day 3: 3/16/22
* A beautiful rendition of a good morning song (consisting solely of "good morning" and "meow". I'll leave it as an exercise for the reader to guess who was who.)
* A treat scavenger hunt (whereby I shake the treat container and throw three kibbles in opposite directions)
* Toys played with: tin foil balls (she found these from somewhere on her own); plastic lid (no idea where she got this, but it bounces in a fun way); plastic bag; we briefly toyed with a receipt, too.
* Humans talked with IRL: Lauren (sold some furniture); Jake (sold a mirror); Janet, Satchel, Mac at boxing
* Lots of phone calls (but those are "virtual")
* Meows had a chill day today. Lots of sleep and she learned to entertain herself with some toys (trash).
* Picked her up (bare arms, too! I was feeling brave!). Held for 3.2 seconds
* Mocked by Jerred and Codi for my Meow Meow diaries.

#### Day 4: 3/17/22
* Meows seems less patient with my Dance Church antics this AM (she's was a bit edgier with more claw swipes)
* Toys: String
* We played a fun game called "how long will Meows walk around with the strings on her back"
* Other cat cuddles: Zz and ficus. No attacks. So much easier to pet a cat that wants to be petted.
* Not much Meows interaction at all today
* Most friends IRL! Jerred, Erica, Katie, Naomi
* Other IRL: Mac & Michael (boxing)

#### Day 5: 3/18/22
* AM: Meowing A LOT for attention. Try to pet, walks away (per usual) or tried to bite me. Ugh. "YOU'RE HARD TO PET!!"
* Busy day for me, didn't have much time to pet/play, so Meows entertained herself a lot today
* Humans IRL: Dr, X-Ray tech, nurse (Zoom Care); Tanner (boxing)
* Lots of assorted phone calls for health, home, family, work
* Today was also a lot because I lost my CC. And confirmed I have a broken tailbone. Whoop whoop.
* High note interaction of the day: Meows (willingly) got it my lap and snuggled (for several minutes). And then shed a toooon of hair all over my sweats. XD
* Toys played with: plastic bag; toilet paper tube

#### Day 6: 3/19/22
* Toys played with: tin foil balls
* Mick came home today. Clearly I took poor notes as I have nothing else to report. That or I was out of the house most of the day.

## Trip two: Mick goes to AZ
#### Day 0: 4/4/22
* Bonus: I ripped my pants and missed having a human to tell IRL. Emma got the call instead.
#### Day 1: 4/5/22
* Toys played with: tin foil balls; sticky tape from Azazie (Lol I stuck it to her)
* some meows at night, lots of leg rubs
* Humans I talked to: Tanner + Janet (boxing)

#### Day 2: 4/6/22
* Lots of big noises (vacuuming upstairs and plumber) so Meows spent lots of time hiding under the bed today
* Gave her some treats; she eventually came back out
* Toys: Paper balls because I couldn't find foil balls
* Meows was serenaded twice today: the fan-favorite Good Morning Meows song, and the new hit single "Meow" (encompasses a wide range of styles, from pop to nursery rhyme to funeral dirge. I am accepting calls from recording labels now)

#### Day 3: 4/7/22
* The usual morning leg rubs while going to the bathroom
* 3 treats + good pets after my AM walk
    * Despite this, LOTS of meows/wanting attention. We didn't do the classic Good Morning Meows song, so maybe that's what's she's missing. (More likely, she's probably pining for Mick, but a girl can hope about her angelic singing)
